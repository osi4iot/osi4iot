OSI4IOT is an IOT platform based on the integration and extension with custom code of several open source packages. This repository contains the implementation of the OSI4OT platform.

## Description

The OSI4IOT platform is a web-based IOT platform for monitoring in real time industrial assets and structures. Besides, the platform allows the implementation of Digital Twins Models (DTM) of those assests. A 3D representation of these DTM can be visualized in the web viewer of the platform. The different objects of the DTM are animated in function of the values received from the sensors. Results provided by Finite Elements Method (FEM) models can also be integrated in the DTM. <br/><br/>

## Getting Started

### Requirements

In order to have the OSI4IOT platform running correctly, the following requirements must be met:
-	Installation of Docker in the Operative System (OS). Please read: [![Link:Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-Manual-blue?style=flat&logo=GitBook&logoColor=blue&link=LINK)](./docs/docker.md).
-	Creation of a Telegram Bot for notification. Please read: [![Link:Telegram](https://img.shields.io/badge/Telegram-Manual-blue?style=flat&logo=GitBook&logoColor=blue&link=LINK)](./docs/telegram.md).
    -	Obtain the Telegram bot token.
    -	Obtain the group ID of the Telegram group for the main organization's default group.
    -	Obtain the Telegram invitation link for the main organization's default group.
-	Have a domain name to access the platform through a webpage.
-	Have an email address to send notifications from the platform. The password for this email is also required.

## Installation

The OSI4IOT platform must to be installed by mean a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool called `osi4iot`. To install the `osi4iot` in your machine it is neccesary to download from Github the proper installer for your operating system:

    // Installer Linux amd64:
    curl -o osi4iot_installer_linux_x64.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osi4iot/osi4iot/master/utils/osi4iot_cli/dist/linux_x64/osi4iot_installer_linux_x64.sh

    // Installer Linux arm64:
    curl -o osi4iot_installer_linux_arm64.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osi4iot/osi4iot/master/utils/osi4iot_cli/dist/linux_arm64/osi4iot_installer_linux_arm64.sh

    // Installer Windows:
    curl -o osi4iot_installer_win_x64.ps1 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osi4iot/osi4iot/master/utils/osi4iot_cli/dist/win_x64/osi4iot_installer_winx_x64.ps1

Once the appropriate installer for your operating system has been downloaded, it must be executed. For example, if you are using a Linux ARM 64-bit system use 

    bash osi4iot_installer_linux_arm64.sh

Once the `osi4iot` CLI tool has been successfully installed, then initialize the OS4IOT platform by typing

    mkdir <my project>  // Example: mkdir iot_fiber4yard
    cd <myproject>      // Example: cd iot_fiber4yard
    osi4iot

<summary> OSI4IOT ecosystem </summary>  
<p>
The `OSI4IOT` platform is not limited to monitor different sensors and to provide an equivalent 3D digital twin of an asset. When considering the IOT technologies, large and distinct information can be gathered, post-processed and generated by different stakeholders. To control that the information is only accessible to the right person, the platform considers different levels of abstraction:

-	Organizations
-	Groups
-	Devices
-	Assets

![img:glossary:industry4.0](./docs/img/industry4_0.svg)



</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Organizations </summary>  
<p>

`Organizations` are the most external level of hierarchy found in the platform. An `Organization` represents an `stakeholder` in the `OSI4IOT ecosystem`. A `stakeholder` can be either a `cluster of organizations` or a `unique organization`. The contents of a `stakeholder` is not limitted to the `partial` or `complete` content of the `same` organization, but `partial` or `complete` contents of `different` organizations. 
<br/><br/>
![img:glossary:stakeholders](./docs/img/stakeholders.svg)

Only the `platform admin` has access to all the information stored in each `stakeholder`, however, `different organizations` can share with each other partial information through a `organization-to-organization message protocol`.

### The simple organization
___
The simplest stakeholder would be to harbor the `partial` or `complete` contents of a `unique organization`. In this case the stakeholder could be just a company and the immediate inner level of hierarchy, the `group` level, could be departments of the company.

### Partners and more complex structures
___
When the structure of the stakeholder is not straightforward, for example in the case of a `cluster of organizations` harboring `partial` or `complete` content of the `different` organizations.

This type of structure could be useful in the case of a `single organization` that not only subdivides its structure into departments at the `group` level, but also when it has to manage data coming from different sources such as partner organizations, customers and suppliers integrated into the platform.

The most complex infrastructure that can be deployed and integrated in the `OSI4IOT` platform would be the case of different organizations working together (`cluster`) and wanting to digitalize and interconnect their processes and information generated. In this case the stakeholder level would be the `cluster` and the `group` level would be comprised from `organization's departments` to `partners`.

Inside the platform, the `organizations` or `stakeholders` are geolocated and displayed in the map with all their content information (`groups`, `devices` and `assets`).

In the map, first you can see a general view with all the `organizations` included in the platform.

<br/><br/>
![img:glossary:industry4.0:map](./docs/img/web-map-orgs.png)

If one of the `leaflets` are selected, the view will focus on the building of the selected `organization`.

<br/><br/>
![img:glossary:stakeholders:ma](./docs/img/web_orgs.png)

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Groups </summary>  
<p>

The next level of hierarchy is the `group`. This level offers the possibility to divide the data stored in the platform in different compartments. This way only members that are at the `organizations` level can access to all the groups, but a unique member of a specific group cannot access the information of another group.

![img:glossary:groups](./docs/img/groups.svg)

Although a member of `Group 1` would not have access to `Group 2`. There is the possibility to share information between groups using a `group-to-group message protocol` similar to the protocol between `organizations`.

Inside the platform, the `groups` are geolocated and displayed in the map inside the domain of their `organization`, the information that can be displayed are the `devices` and `nodes` of the `group`.


![img:glossary:groups:map](./docs/img/web_group.png)

</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary> Devices </summary>  
<p>
The type of information stored inside a `group` are `devices`. These are the next hierarchy level. Each `group` within an `organization` can have several `devices` connected to internet to send data. These `devices` can be PLCs, microcontrollers, microcomputers (like Raspberry Pi), IOT gateways (like SIMATIC IOT2050 of Siemens), etc. 
<br/><br/>

![img:glossary:devices](./docs/img/devices.svg)

In the platform, the `devices` are geolocated inside their corresponding `group` and displayed with a bubble. Each `device` contains `assets`.
<br/><br/>
![img:glossary:devices:map](./docs/img/web_dev.png)
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Assets </summary>  
<p>

A `device` can have one or more industrial machines connected to it in order to control the production process. This machines or parts of a machine are represented by an abstraction called `asset`.
<br/><br/>
![img:glossary:assets](./docs/img/assets.svg)

Inside an `asset` can have the following components:

-	Sensors

    An `asset` can have multiple sensors to measure the relevant parameters that allow defining its status. Temperature, pressure, viscosity or accelerometer sensors are typically used in the manufacturing industry.

-	Digital twins

    An `asset` can have one or several digital twins. A digital twin is a virtual model designed for accurately reflect the physical state of the asset. The function of the digital twin models are the following. 

    -	Asset state monitoring
    -	Predictive maintenance
    -	Alert system in case of incidents

    To implement a digital twin, machine learning models trained by mean of the data collected by the sensors, can be used. Other methodologies, such as the application of model order reduction to physically-based model are also available.

-	Asset state

    The state of the `asset` at a given instant is defined by a set of parameters. These parameters are obtained from the data collected by the sensors and from some evolution model. It is important to store in a database the historical evolution of the asset state so that they can be used in the development of digital twins.

-	Asset topics

    The communication protocols typically used in IOT technologies (MQTT, Apache Kafka and Apache Pulsar) use the term topic to refer to the text string used to filter the messages that a publisher sends to the receivers.
    It is necessary to store in database a list of the different topics used to send data related with the assets.

<!-- -	Product list
-	Product tracking
-	Supplies management -->

</details>

<details>
<summary> Role System  </summary> 
<p>
Once you understand the key points of the platform components, the hierarchy levels and what is the purpose of each level. The other missing part is how to manage the platform components. This is the purpose of the role managing system, which associates a role to certain levels.

If logged into the platform, the first thing that you will see is the role menu bar in the left. From bottom to top of the role menu bar we have:

- Super Admin: role associated generally to the people who are in charge of the `platform` and generally install it.
- Organizations Admin: role associated to the management of the `organizations`, creation of `groups`, etc.
- Groups Admin: role associated to the management of `groups`, creation of `devices` and `assets`.
- User: role associated with the management of the personal information of the corresponding user.

![img:glossary:roles:general](./docs/img/role_general.png)

The hierarchy of roles is established as: 

`Super Admin` > `Organizations Admin` > `Groups Admin` > `User`

The `home` button is just the viewer and it is available to all the roles. The descendent order implicates that the role below is of higher rank, for example a `Super Admin` can manage the same information as the `Organizations Admin`, but not otherwise. 

The following picture illustrates the information that can be accessed by the different roles.
 <br/><br/>
![img:glossary:roles](./docs/img/roles.svg)
</p>
</details>

## Usage

This section aims to explain what can be done and how the different services provided by the `OSI4IOT` platform can be accessed.

<details>
<summary> Home screen  </summary>  
<p>
The home screen hosted in the the domain provided in the CLI offers 4 possibilities:

- Platform assistant:

    The core of the platform where the different users can access to all information stored in the platform. It gives access to the managing role menus.

- Dashboards

    Use this option to open Grafana application in another browser tab.

- Digital twin simulator

    This option is a simulator for the Digital Twin Models. This simulator allows to modify the parameters of the `DTM` in real time. With this, you can display the model in a device and control the simulation parameters from another one.

- Mobile sensors (Only Android devices)

    This option is used to demonstrate that the platform also integrates mobile technology. For example, it is possible to capture the accelerometers of an Android phone or even use machine learning models to label information from a picture taken by the phone.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Login  </summary>  
<p>
The first thing that is needed is the access through the login screen. If you are the `Super Admin`, then you will login with the credentials introduced in the `CLI`, however if you are not the one who initialized the platform or have a lower rank assigned, then you will need to be invited by the `Super Admin`. This is easily done by means of adding a new user (you need an e-mail) in the `Global users` tab of the actions available to the `Super Admin`.

Click on the top right icon to login.

![img:login_0](./docs/img/web_login_0.png)

Then fill the form and submit.

![img:login_1](./docs/img/web_login_1.png)

Then you will be redirected to the Platform assistant app, where you will be able to see the different organizations in the map.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Dashboards  </summary>  
<p>

One of the type of information that can be visualized are dashboards, useful to desplay simple sensor data and with the option to send alerts through the notification system when a certain threshold is trespassed. 

It can be accessed from the viewer by clicking the `dashboard` icon. 

![img:dashboards_0](./docs/img/web_dashboards_0.png)

Then the dashboard is displayed. In this example the measurements of a temperature sensor.

![img:dashboards_1](./docs/img/web_dashboards_1.png)

The same result can be achieved from the `Dashboards` option in the home screen. A list of the different dashboards is shown, the access to the list depends on the account rank of the user, then select the appropiate dashboard.

![img:dashboards_2](./docs/img/web_dashboards_2.png)


</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Digital Twin Model  </summary>  
<p>

The other type of information that can be displayed are the `Digital Twin Models` (`DTM`). They can be accessed when selecting a device, and by clicking the `DTM` icon (three boxes), the viewer will load a 3D digital twin.

![img:dtm_0](./docs/img/web_dtm_0.png)

Here you can control and monitor the sensor information, in this example, the level of water in a tank on top of a building structure. The rendering offers the possibility to show the current results in the format of a `Finite Element Method` mesh or in short `FEM` mesh. For example the distribution of stresses in the floor and at the current time to plot the deformation, in real scale or custom. The platform offers the possibility to lock the measurements and use the simulator to observe hypothetical scenarios. Sensors embedded in the digital twin can also be accessed by clicking the sensor in the 3D model.

![img:dtm_1](./docs/img/web_dtm_1.png)

It can also be the case that you may want to monitor an asset with the 3D view while simulating the model with an external device. This can be done by using the `Digital Twin Simulator` option in the home screen. You will see in real time the modifications introduced in the simulation.

![img:dtm_2](./docs/img/web_dtm_2.png)


</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary> Node-RED  </summary>  
<p>

Any 'DTM' requires a logic to analyze in real time the information coming from the sensors and decide whether to trigger an alert when something goes wrong. This task can be done with the help of Node-RED, an open source package that allows graphically to interconnect the data and manipulate it. You can either create custom boxes or use existing template boxes to design the flow diagram of the logic of your `devices`.

![img:node-red](./docs/img/web-node-red.png)

The Node-RED instances can be accessed by clicking into the Node-RED icon in the map.

![img:node-red:access](./docs/img/web-node-red-access.png)

<details><summary> How to send messages through the MQTT protocol </summary>
<p>

The platform uses `Mosquitto` as the message broker. This message protocol uses a `publish`/`subscribe` model associated to a `topic`. `Topics` are the channels of information where a `device` can connect to `publish` data or `subscribe` to fetch information.

The platform implements a specific format to communicate through the MQTT protocol. Note that `devices` are associated to `groups`, and they send information through a `topic`. However, the format also takes into account the type of information that is sent in the `topic`. Therefore the format required to establish communication from a `device` to the platform is:

    <topic type>/Group_<group hash>/Device_<device hash>/Topic_<topic hash>

Topic types:

- dev2pdb : Device to platform database.
- dev2pdb_wt : Device to platform database with timestamp.
- dev2pdb_ma : Device to platform database messages array.
- dev_sim_2dtm: Simulated device to DTM.
- dtm_as2pdb : DTM assets state to platform database.
- dtm_sim_as2dts: DTM simulated assets state to DTS.          
- dtm_fmv2pdb: DTM fem modal value to platform database.  
- dtm_sim_fmv2dts: DTM simulated fem modal value to DTS.

Besides complying with the format, the security of the platform ensures that only the roles that can manage devices are allowed to send or receive information through a topic. Therefore you need to connect through credentials to the platform prior to use a `topic`.

Not only users can use their credentials to send or receive information. There is the option that the `device` that `publish` and `subscribes` to the `topic` does itself. In that case, there is the option to download the `SSL certificates`, three certficates (`CA`,`Client Certificate`, `Client Key`). This method enables the device to send or fetch information without any account.

![img:mqtt:ssl](./docs/img/mqtt-SSL.png)

There is a more complete manual on how to communicate and use the MQTT protocol available in [![Link:MQTTX](https://img.shields.io/badge/MQTTX-Manual-blue?style=flat&logo=GitBook&logoColor=blue&link=LINK)](./docs/MQQTX.md).
