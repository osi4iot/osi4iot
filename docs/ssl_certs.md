# SSL Certificates

Options available:

1. No Certs:

    The simplest, run the platform without domain SSL certification.
2. Certs provided by a CA:

    In this case, you will need to request the certificates to a Certificate Authority (CA).
3. Letâ€™s encrypt certs and AWS Route 53:

    The generation in this case is automatic but the Route 53 is a paid service.
4. AWS Certificate Manager:

    This option is used when deploying the platform on an AWS cluster.
