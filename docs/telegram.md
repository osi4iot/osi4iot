First you need to send a message to BotFather. Visit: 
https://telegram.me/botfather
Then to start creating a bot type:
/start

Then complete the prompts required by the BotFather form.

If everything has gone correctly, the bot token will be generated.

Once the bot token and the bot has been created. Create a Group and add the bot you have created. Select New Group.
 
Figure 7. Create a Telegram group.
Then it will prompt to add members. Remember that when the bot was created it provides you a link to send a message to it. Here the username will be shown with an @ at the beginning of the username.

Add the bot as a Member of the group your are creating.

When all the group members have been added beside the bot, you will be prompt to fill the Group Name.

Then the group is created and this should be visible on the screen.

When the group is created, now you have the three following things:
•	Bot token: 5342540378:AAHrJ4ABFiX54m6uf9RvxHxLRKeo0dGiHA0
•	Chat id: -694425020
•	Invitation Url: https://t.me/+MgGprvw5SAozODq0
Note that the Bot token is obtained from the BotFather chat, after filling the form. These three keys are needed later when creating an organization in the Command Line Interface (CLI) of the platform. In particular when initialising the platform.
